# Casino Chain Management Services

This is a casino chain management app which will allow users to view and
manage different branches of their casinos including the rooms in them and game
tables. The dealers who work at the casino, and the players that play at the casino both
through a party that stays in the same hotel room and shares an account, and through
game sessions where a patron plays against players or the house and their total gain
(or loss) is recorded.
